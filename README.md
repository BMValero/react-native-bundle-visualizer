# react-native-bundle-visualizer

See what's inside of your react-native bundle ðŸ“¦

![bundle-visualizer-animation](./react-native-bundle-visualizer2.gif)

Uses the awesome [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer) to visualize the output of the [Metro bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro).

## Purpose

Sometimes, importing a single javascript library can drastically increase your bundle size. This package helps you to identify such a library, so you can keep the bundle size low and loading times fast.

## Usage

Install as a dev-dependency:

`yarn add --dev react-native-bundle-visualizer`
	
And run it:

	yarn run react-native-bundle-visualizer

*or when using npm:*

	npm install --save-dev react-native-bundle-visualizer
	./node_modules/.bin/react-native-bundle-visualizer


## Command line arguments

All command-line arguments are optional. By default a production build will be created for the `ios` platform.

| Option          | Description                                        | Example                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `platform`      | Platform to build (default is **ios**)             | `--platform android`              |
| `dev`           | Dev or production build (default is **false**)     | `--dev false`                     |
| `entry-file`    | Entry-file (when omitted tries to auto-resolve it) | `--entry-file ./index.android.js` |
| `bundle-output` | Output bundle-file (default is **tmp**)            | `--bundle-output ./myapp.bundle`  |




## Usage with older react-native versions and the Haul bundler

As of `react-native-bundle-visualizer` version 2.x, the direct output of the [Metro bundler](https://github.com/facebook/metro) is visualized using the [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).

Prior to version 2, the Haul bundler was used which used Webpack. If you are having problems visualizing the output for older react-native versions, or you want to explicitly use the Haul bundler, [please check out the V1 documentation](./README_v1.md).
